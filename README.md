## Irene's portfolio site.

Hello! Thank you for visiting the source code of my portfolio site found at [`irenetruong.com`](https://irenetruong.com/).

Some features I'm proud of:

- Built in Next.js
- ES6, React Hooks
- Fade in project cards in /project page
- Active classes for navigation, and for project filter on select
- Project skill filter
- 404 page if you try to go to a non-existing page
